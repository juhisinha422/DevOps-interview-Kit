# DevOps / Cloud Engineer Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. Docker Image Size Increased from 200MB to 2GB

### Question

Docker image sizes have grown from 200MB to 2GB over 6 months of development, causing deployment times to increase significantly. How would you investigate and fix this without disrupting the current deployment pipeline?

### Answer

> “First, I would investigate the image growth without disrupting the current pipeline by comparing older and newer Docker images using commands like `docker history`, `docker image inspect`, and tools such as Dive. This helps identify which layers or dependencies caused the increase from 200MB to 2GB.
>
> Common reasons are:
>
> * Large dependencies or unused packages added over time
> * Copying unnecessary files into the image
> * Multiple layers created by separate RUN commands
> * Build artifacts, logs, or cache files inside the image
> * Using heavy base images like full Ubuntu instead of Alpine/slim variants
>
> To fix it safely, I would:
>
> * Introduce multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime environments
> * Switch to lightweight base images like Alpine or slim images
> * Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
> * Combine RUN commands and clean package cache during build
> * Store logs and temp files outside the container
> * Scan for unused dependencies
>
> Since we should not disrupt the current deployment pipeline, I would create an optimized image in a separate branch or parallel CI pipeline, test it in lower environments, compare deployment time and application behavior, then gradually roll it out using blue-green or canary deployment.
>
> I’d also add image size monitoring in CI/CD with threshold alerts so future image bloat is detected early.”

# 2. AI Tools Used in Day-to-Day Work

### Question

What AI tools do you actually use in your day-to-day work, and what do you use them for?

### Answer

> “In my day-to-day work, I mainly use AI tools to improve productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and speed up troubleshooting.
>
> I use ChatGPT for:
>
> * Writing and optimizing shell scripts, Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD pipelines
> * Troubleshooting errors quickly by analyzing logs and configurations
> * Generating automation ideas and documentation
> * Learning new AWS or DevOps concepts faster
>
> I use GitHub Copilot inside VS Code for:
>
> * Auto-completing code and scripts
> * Writing Dockerfiles, YAML files, and Python/Bash scripts faster
> * Reducing repetitive coding effort
>
> I’ve also used Claude for:
>
> * Summarizing large documentation
> * Reviewing configurations and getting detailed explanations
> * Comparing different implementation approaches
>
> But I don’t rely on AI blindly. I always validate outputs, especially for production infrastructure, security, Terraform changes, and deployment scripts before applying them.”

# 3. Top Technical Strengths

### Question

What are your top two technical abilities that make you a strong engineer — things that actually give you an edge when working with engineering or data teams?

### Answer

> “I think my top two technical strengths are troubleshooting complex production issues and building reliable automation.
>
> First, I’m strong in troubleshooting and root cause analysis. In cloud and DevOps environments, issues can come from infrastructure, networking, Kubernetes, CI/CD, or application layers. I’m good at analyzing logs, metrics, monitoring dashboards, and system behavior to quickly identify the root cause and reduce downtime. That helps engineering teams resolve incidents faster.
>
> Second, I’m strong in automation and infrastructure optimization. I’ve worked with Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and AWS services to automate deployments, infrastructure provisioning, and operational tasks. I focus on reducing manual effort, improving deployment reliability, and making systems more scalable and consistent.
>
> I think these two skills give me an edge because they help both engineering and data teams move faster while maintaining stability and reliability in production environments.”

# 4. Why Looking for New Opportunities

### Question

What’s making you want to look for other opportunities right now? What’s driving it?

### Answer

> “I’ve learned a lot in my current role, especially around AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and production support. Now I’m looking for opportunities where I can work on more large-scale cloud infrastructure, automation, and modern DevOps practices.
>
> What’s really driving me is the chance to grow technically, take on more ownership, and work in an environment where I can contribute to scalable and reliable systems. I’m especially interested in teams that are focused on cloud-native technologies, automation, and continuous improvement.
>
> I also want exposure to more challenging projects where I can expand my skills in areas like Kubernetes, infrastructure automation, observability, and system reliability engineering.”

# 5. 6-Day Work Week

### Question

Some companies follow a 6-day work week. Is that something you’re open to?

### Answer (Balanced Response)

> “I’m open to it depending on the work culture, learning opportunities, and overall role responsibilities. My main focus is being part of a strong engineering environment where I can grow technically and contribute effectively. At the same time, I also value productivity and long-term sustainability, so I’d prefer a balanced and efficient work culture.”

### Alternative Answer (If Not Comfortable)

> “I generally prefer a 5-day work week because I believe it helps maintain long-term productivity and work-life balance. However, I’m flexible during critical releases, production incidents, or important project phases when extra effort is needed.”
