✅ Difference between CMD and Entrypoint command in Docker?
➡️In Docker, `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` are two instructions that serve a similar purpose: they specify the command to run when a container is started from an image. However, there are key differences between them:

CMD (Command)

- `CMD` sets the default command to run when a container is started.
- It can be overridden by the user when running the container using the `docker run` command.
- If `CMD` is not specified, the container will run the default command specified by the base image.
- `CMD` can be used to provide a default command, but it's not as flexible as `ENTRYPOINT`.

Example:
```
FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]
```
In this example, when a container is started from this image, it will run the `echo` command with the argument "Hello, World!".

ENTRYPOINT (Entry Point)

- `ENTRYPOINT` sets the command to run when a container is started, and it cannot be overridden by the user.
- It's used to specify a command that should always be run when the container starts.
- `ENTRYPOINT` can be used in combination with `CMD` to provide a default command, but with the flexibility to override it.
- When using `ENTRYPOINT`, the `CMD` instruction is used to provide default arguments.

Example:
```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello, World!"]
```
In this example, when a container is started from this image, it will run the `echo` command with the argument "Hello, World!". The user can override the default argument by providing their own argument when running the container:
```
docker run -it myimage "Hello, Docker!"
```
In summary:

- `CMD` sets a default command that can be overridden.
- `ENTRYPOINT` sets a command that cannot be overridden, but can be used with `CMD` to provide default arguments.

When to use each:

- Use `CMD` when you want to provide a default command that can be overridden by the user.
- Use `ENTRYPOINT` when you want to specify a command that should always be run when the container starts, and you want to provide default arguments that can be overridden.
